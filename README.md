# xsd-to-classes

The XsdToClasses tool is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Studio that automates code generation from XML Schema Definition files (XSD), and allows the programmer to control, tune and override code generation.

The tool is available as a free download. It works with Visual Studio 2005, 2008, and 2010. Visual Studio Express Editions from 2005 through 2010 are also supported.

Only code generation in C# is supported. Code generation in VB is implicitly supported by the framework and could be added.
